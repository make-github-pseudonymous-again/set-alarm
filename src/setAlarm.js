/**
 * Set an alarm to trigger at a given date/time specified by a Date object.
 * When triggered, the alarm will call the callback function with passed
 * arguments, if any.
 *
 * We guarantee that the alarm will not trigger before the given date/time.
 * We try to trigger the alarm as soom as the given date/time has passed.
 *
 * Note that we workaround two issues raised by a naive setTimeout
 * implementation:
 *   1. the delay parameter is a 32-bit signed integer
 *   2. taking the first point into account, the resolution time of setAlarm
 *   could be imprecise with large delays (because of setInterval/setTimeout
 *   drift).
 *
 * @param {Function} callback - The Function to call when the alarm triggers.
 * @param {Date} date - The date/time at which to trigger the alarm.
 * @param {...any} rest - The arguments to call the callback with.
 * @returns {Alarm} The alarm object.
